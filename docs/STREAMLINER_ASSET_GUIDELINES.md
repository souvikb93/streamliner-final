# Streamliner case study — asset guidelines

Every visual on the Framer page `/projects/streamliner` (HTML embeds, diagrams, charts, cards) follows this kit, so the case study reads as one project.

## 1. Colour tokens

Use only these. Each hue has a five-step ramp: text/solid → mid → line → soft fill → tint.

| Role | Solid / text | Mid | Line | Soft fill | Tint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Brand / active (Dell blue) | `#0672CB` | `#7DB9EA` | `#C8E3F7` | `#E3F0FA` | `#F2F8FD` |

Dell blue replaces the earlier navy everywhere. Use `#0672CB` for fills, strokes, the token and selected states. Use **`#0063B8` for blue text** (on white or on blue tints: 4.6:1 or better). On a Dell-blue fill, text is white; secondary text is `#F2F8FD`.
| Success / done | `#1E8A4C` | `#9ED9B0` | `#D6F2E1` | — | `#F2FAF5` |
| Warning / regional | `#A15C00` | `#F5A524` | `#F5C97A` | `#FFF1DB` | `#FFF9EE` |
| Danger / reject | `#C62828` | `#F2A7A7` | `#FBDADA` | — | `#FDF5F5` |

Neutrals:

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| ink | `#121212` | Headings and primary text. Never used as a fill. |
| ink-2 | `#454548` | Secondary text and icons |
| muted | `#696970` | Body copy, captions, caps labels (4.5:1 on white) |
| subtle | `#A1A1AA` | Disabled text and placeholder bars |
| line-strong | `#D4D4D8` | Idle node outlines, unused lines |
| line | `#E5E5E5` | Card borders, dividers |
| track | `#F0F1F4` | Tab tracks, progress tracks, chips |
| canvas | `#F4F6FA` | Diagram and map backgrounds, image wells |
| surface | `#FFFFFF` | Cards and nodes |

Map only: the region pins may use a categorical set (Dell blue, `#2E7DDB`, `#7DB9EA`, green, amber, red, `#7C3AED`). Nothing else uses categorical colour.

### State semantics (same in every asset)

- **Dell blue = active or selected**: the current step, a selected tab, a highlighted stat, the loader.
- **Green = done or approved**: finished steps, approved outcomes, positive results.
- **Grey = not yet or not relevant**: upcoming steps are grey outlines. Items outside the current flow are faded to 55%.
- **Amber** = regional or configurable variation. **Red** = rejected or blocked.
- Never rely on colour alone. Always pair it with a label, an icon or a tick.

## 2. Typography

The only font is Inter (400, 500, 600, 700).

| Style | Size / weight | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stat number | 40–44 / 700 | Tracking -0.03em |
| Card title (H4) | 15–19 / 600 | Tracking -0.01em |
| Status title | 18 / 600 | e.g. the diagram's "what is happening" line |
| Body | 14–14.5 / 400 | Line-height 1.55, colour: muted |
| Small | 12–12.5 / 500 | Chips, captions |
| Caps label | 12 / 600 | Uppercase, tracking 0.12em, colour: muted (or Dell blue when it names the active item) |

Diagram node labels are 12 / 600 ink.

## 3. Shape and spacing

- **Radius**: cards 20px; inner items 12px; chips 8px; tabs and pills 999px; diagram nodes 10px.
- **Borders**: 1px `line` on cards; 1.5px strokes on diagram nodes and lines.
- **Spacing**: multiples of 4; card padding 18–26px; grid gaps 12–20px.
- **Shadows**: none on cards. Only the selected tab gets `0 1px 3px rgba(11,59,140,.3)`.

## 4. Components

- **Tabs / toggle**: track `#F0F1F4`, 3px padding, 999px radius. Items are 13px / 600. Selected: Dell blue fill, white text. Always one colour, never a colour per option.
- **Progress stepper**: done = green dot with a white tick and green connector. Current = Dell blue pill with white text and a pulsing dot. Upcoming = white dot with grey outline. When there isn't room, only the current step keeps its label.
- **Cards**: white, 1px line border, 20px radius, no shadow. A highlighted card is a Dell blue fill with white and `#C8E3F7` text.
- **Chips / tags**: soft fill plus solid text of the same hue (e.g. `#C8E3F7` / `#0672CB`), 8px radius.
- **Buttons**: text only, no icons in CTAs. Icon-only controls need an `aria-label`.

## 5. Diagrams and animation

- Lines are orthogonal with 16px rounded corners. They meet a node at the centre of a side. There are no junction dots; branches curve off smoothly. Where two lines must cross, draw a small hop.
- Lines in the current flow are solid `#A1A1AA`. Unused lines are dashed `#D4D4D8`. A travelled line turns green.
- The moving token is a Dell blue circle with a white stroke. It travels under the nodes, along the lines, through node centres, and never jumps.
- The working state is a light-blue fill plus a Dell blue outline that fills from left to right as the loader. Done is a green outline and fill, with no tick inside the node.
- Timing: each system works for 2.6–3.2s, holds 1.6s, and handovers take at least 1.6s. Leave time to read.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 6. Framer embed rules

- Start every embed's CSS with `html,body{width:100%}body{display:block!important}body>div{width:100%}`. Framer centres and shrinks embed content otherwise.
- Keep the background transparent. The page supplies white.
- Max width 1200px. Set the embed height so the whole asset fits one viewport.
- No `//` comments in scripts: newlines are collapsed when the HTML is pushed, which breaks them.
- Source files live in the session scratchpad `kit/` folder, one file per embed.

## 7. Embed inventory (desktop, page `LIdyc6Q9n`)

New embeds start from `_base.css`: every `*.src.html` has `{{BASE}}` substituted into it to build the `.html`.

### Journey-map patterns
- Action cards are white.
- Thought cards use the warning tint (`#FFF9EE` / `#F5C97A`).
- Opportunity cards use the Dell-blue tint.
- Touchpoints are pill chips with stroke SVG icons, never emoji.
- Feeling is a dashed curve. Its dots and labels are green for positive, grey for neutral and red for negative.
- Detail opens in a kit modal: radius 20, a close button and Esc to dismiss.

## Fixed-frame pattern (world map, TKuq5vJQK)

Data-driven embeds must never resize when the selected record changes. The rule:

1. Outer `.wrap` gets an explicit `height`; children use `height:100%;min-height:0` (never `min-height:Npx`).
2. Every block with variable text is either **reserved** (fixed `height` + `overflow:hidden`) or **absorbing** (`flex:1;min-height:0;overflow:hidden`). Exactly one absorber per card.
3. Single-line values: `white-space:nowrap;overflow:hidden;text-overflow:ellipsis` + a `title` attribute with the full string.
4. Multi-line values: `-webkit-line-clamp` with a matching `-webkit-box-orient:vertical`.
5. Below the stacking breakpoint, release the locks: `height:auto` on wrap/side/card, `flex:none` on the absorber.
6. Set the Framer `<Embed height>` to `wrap height + wrap padding*2`. Never leave it `fit-content` — an HTML embed collapses.
7. **Pin `html,body` too.** Framer measures the embed document and writes the measured value back into the node height (observed: 460px silently became 566px). A fixed `.wrap` is not enough — set `html,body{height:<embed height>;overflow:hidden}` and release it in the stacked media query.

Verify with a headless probe that forces every record and compares `getBoundingClientRect().height` and `scrollHeight`; all records must report identical numbers and `scrollHeight <= clientHeight`.

## Responsive rules (all 15 embeds, 2026-09-22)

The page has three Framer breakpoints: `L` 1200 (`LIdyc6Q9n`), `M` 810 (`NlPNOzxrK`), `S` 390 (`Sk8va5bUZ`). M and S are **replicas** — they inherit L's children and hold no overrides, so an `<Embed>` has ONE height shared by all three widths. A fixed px height therefore clips tablet and phone.

Rules now applied to every embed:

1. **`height="fit-content"` on the node.** Framer measures the iframe per breakpoint, so each width gets its own height. (`k567uewrD` had been on fit-content for weeks — it works; the earlier "embeds collapse" note was wrong.)
2. **Desktop lock inside the embed:** `@media (min-width:900px){body{min-height:<old px height>}}`. Desktop content then measures exactly what the fixed height used to be, so switching to fit-content is pixel-neutral. Measure at the REAL embed width (1072 at L after the section's 64px gutters), not 1200.
3. **Phone tier** `@media (max-width:440px)`: padding ≥24→16, 20–23→14, 16–19→12, 12–15→10; gap ≥28→16, 24–27→14, 16–23→12, 12–15→10; display numbers ≥30px→26px.
4. **Wide diagrams scroll, never squeeze.** Journey (`cJPS6EXdE`) and system (`OX6dWZqL5`) get `overflow-x:auto` on the scroll parent plus `min-width:860px` / `900px` on the diagram below 760px. Squeezing truncated every journey card to "C..".
5. **Grid overflow:** use `minmax(0,1fr)` not `1fr`, and drop `white-space:nowrap` below 760px, or min-content forces horizontal scroll (hit `zX_dFoAE6` and `k567uewrD`).

Verify with an iframe harness at 1072 / 682 / 350 / 262 comparing `body.scrollHeight` and `body.scrollWidth`; `scrollWidth` must never exceed the iframe width.

**Still owner-only:** the section padding is `64px` on every breakpoint, leaving 262px of usable width on a 390px phone. Per-breakpoint overrides on replica children are not reachable through the unframer MCP — set them on the M/S canvas (suggest 32px tablet, 20px phone).


## Synthesis + method assets (2026-09-23)

**Synthesis `k567uewrD`** rebuilt to 644px (cap was 700). Decluttered: dropped the F0x chips on insight cards (the lines carry linkage now), findings trimmed to title + 2-line clamp, opportunity cards start white with a blue tint and only go solid `#0672CB` when selected. Band gaps 44 -> 56px so the connectors have room; card padding 12/14 -> 14/16; row gap 12 -> 14.

Behaviour: auto-cycles the three insight chains at 3.6s, hover anywhere pauses (status line says so), clicking any card selects it and holds 20s. Selection dims everything off-chain to .38 and draws the hot paths with a `stroke-dashoffset` 100 -> 0 sweep (every path carries `pathLength=100`). Finding -> insight edges fan out by source index so parallel runs do not overlap.

Evidence chains: I01 <- F01,F03 / I02 <- F01,F04 / I03 <- F02,F04, each insight feeding its matching opportunity.

**Method `jDPWO0srd`** is a new embed appended inside the Discovery section `k6Q8TTr7L`, after the world map and the 17->7->3->1 funnel. 605px. Covers the research protocol: 4 phases (scope / guide / interviews / playback), a 60-minute session broken into 5+25+18+12 minute segments with a colour key, and where each artefact lived.

**Node ordering warning:** `duplicateNode` on a SECTION appends the copy to the END of the page root, not next to the original, and the MCP cannot reorder root children. To add a block in a specific section, duplicate an EMBED inside that section instead - the copy lands as the last child of that same section - then rewrite its html.

## Typeface: Uncut Sans variable (2026-09-23)

Every asset in this project now loads the **Uncut Sans variable** cut, self-hosted from the official repo via jsDelivr and pinned to a commit:

    @font-face{font-family:'Uncut Sans';
     src:url(https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kaspernordkvist/uncut_sans@b3b42467781e3bd98c68f2d70eba325196e7d9c5/Webfonts/UncutSans-Variable.woff2) format('woff2');
     font-weight:300 700;font-style:normal;font-display:swap}

Stack is `font-family:'Uncut Sans',-apple-system,sans-serif`. The Google Fonts Inter `<link>` was removed from every embed, and SVG text uses `font-family="Uncut Sans"` (journey feeling labels) and `.lab{font-family:'Uncut Sans'}` (system diagram).

**Do not use `@fontsource/uncut-sans`** — that package ships static cuts only, no variable file. The variable woff2 (78 KB, verified `wOF2` magic, served as `font/woff2`) exists only in `kaspernordkvist/uncut_sans` at `Webfonts/UncutSans-Variable.woff2`. Pin the commit; a bare `@main` is not reproducible.

Re-measured every asset at 1072 / 682 / 350 after the swap: no clipping, no horizontal overflow, every desktop height still equal to its lock. The world map's fixed 34px fact rows and 62px header survive the wider face — a 7-region truncation probe reported NO TRUNCATION.

## As-is service blueprint (riEAs3sap, 2026-09-23)

New interactive asset, 560px, in the "Making the Research Explorable" section right after the journey map. Returns methods, USA.

Six phases (request, method, hand over, transit, inspection, refund) by five blueprint layers, with the three standard dividers drawn as dashed rules: **line of interaction**, **line of visibility**, **line of internal interaction**.

Layer colour coding: evidence `#F4F6FA`, customer actions white, frontstage `#F2F8FD`/`#C8E3F7`, backstage white/`#D4D4D8`, support systems `#FFF9EE`/`#F5C97A`. Same stepped `#E3F0FA` phase header, same 150px grey label column and the same click-to-open modal as the journey map. Below 760px the grid scrolls horizontally at `min-width:940px` rather than squeezing.

## No all-caps labels (2026-09-23)

`text-transform:uppercase` is banned across every asset in this project — it reads as machine-generated. All 19 occurrences were removed (`.label`, `.eyebrow`, `.band em`, `.c em`, `.hd em`, `.col em`, `.box em`, `.rule em`, `.insight em`, `.ln em`, `.tag`, `.o em`). Where a rule had tiny-caps tracking, `letter-spacing` was reduced to `.02em` and any `10`/`10.5px` size bumped to `11px`, so sentence case still reads as a label rather than body copy.

Two hard-coded strings were rewritten too: the modules band `STREAMLINER · CRE LIFECYCLE` → `Streamliner · CRE lifecycle`, and the rules-engine source chip `RULES` → `Rules`. Genuine acronyms stay capitalised: CRE, SODS, RIMS, PDSL, SFDC, OMEGA, ABACUS, OTM, ARB, HMW, ANZ, USA.

Sentence case is narrower than uppercase, so nothing re-clipped: every desktop height still equals its lock and there is no horizontal overflow at 350px.

## Synthesis connectors: built, never idle (k567uewrD, 2026-09-23)

The connectors are **not drawn at rest**. Every `path` starts at `opacity:0` with `stroke-dasharray:100 100; stroke-dashoffset:100`; only `.hot` reveals it and animates `stroke-dashoffset` to 0 over `.6s`. Nothing else in the card carries a resting line, so the stage is quiet between cycles.

Each cycle plays one evidence chain as a sequence, not a state flip:

    finding A → line A→insight → finding B → line B→insight
      → insight (highlight + scale pop) → line insight→opportunity → opportunity

Timing: 560ms per card step, 680ms per link step, 2400ms hold at the end, ~360ms lead-in. The insight uses a `pop` keyframe (1 → 1.1 → 1.045) and stays at 1.045 while it is the active card; `prefers-reduced-motion` and every width ≤820px drop the transform entirely.

Line geometry is uniform. Horizontal channels sit at `y1 + 26 + (u-1)*16` — inside the 70px `.gap`, above the section band, 16px apart, identical for every group. Each link leaves its source at the card's horizontal centre and enters its target at `width * u/(c+1)`, so two incoming links land at exactly ⅓ and ⅔. Insight→opportunity share a column, so `curve()` returns a plain vertical. Corner radius is capped at 12px.

The `.gap` is 70px (was 56px) so the stage fills its 644px lock instead of leaving 35px of slack, and the channels get clearance from both rows.

Hover pauses, a click freezes the whole chain for that card (a finding reveals every insight it feeds, plus their opportunities) and releases after 20s.

## To-be system diagram — group palette (OX6dWZqL5)

Nodes are coloured by group, not individually. `CO(id)` resolves every colour.

| Group | Nodes | Hex | Contrast on white |
|---|---|---|---|
| Streamliner modules | Create & Edit, Verify & Review, Process & Track, Return Method, Disposition & Recovery | `#0672CB` | 4.62 |
| Case system | SFDC | `#7C3AED` | 6.72 |
| People & channels | Customer, Channels, Care Agent, E-support | `#57575C` | 5.63 |
| Data services | BIL / SODS, PDSL, Delta · RIMS | `#B02071` | 6.14 |
| Logistics | ARB facility, Logistics, OTM | `#A15C00` | 5.74 |
| Finance | ABACUS, OMEGA, Oracle payments | `#0B6E4F` | 6.19 |

The five modules are the only **filled** nodes — that is what makes them read as
the product. Everything else is a white card with a group-coloured border.

Progress rail ticks are `#1E8A4C` with a white check; completed separators use
the same green. The active node scales to 1.5× on a spring and carries a pulse
ring in its own group colour.

Full rationale: `FRAMER_ASSET_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §11.

### Legend (top-left of the canvas)

Two columns inside one 228×204 card at `x:34 y:36`:

- **System group** — colour swatch + name, one row per group, swatch fill is the
  group token itself (no separate legend palette).
- **What moves** — the payload icon carried by the travelling token, so the icon
  in the circle is readable without watching a full cycle:

  | Icon | Meaning | Used by |
  |---|---|---|
  | document | Request | case detail moving into Streamliner |
  | check | Approval | rules-engine verdict moving downstream |
  | box | Package | physical unit in transit |
  | card | Payment | credit or refund |
  | gift | Replacement | replacement order and delivery |
  | tag | Return label | return method and waybill |

To free the top-left block, both return lines (`pay-cust`, `log-cust`) were
rerouted: they still run along the `y:18` lane but now drop down the far-left
edge at `x:16` to `y:306`, then step right into the Customer node's top port.
The old route dropped at `x:50`, straight through where the legend now sits.

### Layout v3 — scale clearance and the return loop

The 1.5× active scale sets the minimum spacing, not aesthetics: a 124px node at
1.5× is 186 wide, so two neighbours need **≥155px between centres** before the
enlarged one touches the idle one. The row was respaced to that rule and the
right-hand column restacked so each Streamliner module sits under the
enterprise system it talks to:

| Row | Nodes (x) |
|---|---|
| y 86 | ARB 1090 · Logistics 1264 |
| y 172 | ABACUS 880 · OMEGA 1090 · Oracle payments 1264 |
| y 360 | Customer 50 · Channels 142 · Care Agent 266 · SFDC 440 · Create & Edit 640 · **Verify & Review 880** · **Process & Track 1090** |
| y 470 | Return Method 880 · Delta · RIMS 1254 |
| y 548 | BIL/SODS 640 · PDSL 1090 · OTM 1254 |

Verify & Review sits under ABACUS, Process & Track under OMEGA. Delta · RIMS and
OTM moved to the bottom-right corner, which was dead space.

The return lines (`pay-cust`, `log-cust`) now close the loop as a full rectangle:
right riser `x:1384` → bottom lane `y:586` → left riser `x:16` → Customer's left
port. That clears the legend completely, so the legend keeps the top-left corner.

### Progress rail

Labels never disappear. The rail wraps to a second line instead
(`flex-wrap:wrap`), and `min-height:76px` reserves both lines so the frame height
does not change between flows. Three visually distinct states:

- **upcoming** — no fill, hollow dot
- **active** — solid pill in the current node's group colour, white text, pulsing dot
- **done** — light green pill `#E9F5EE`, green dot, white check, label intact

Below 760px the rail switches to `nowrap` at `min-width:900px` so it scrolls with
the canvas as one scroll region rather than stacking into four rows.

Heights: 1072 → 700 (content 694), 682 → 679, 350 → 676. Desktop lock unchanged.

### Layout v4 — even pitch, landing, 1.3× scale

**Row pitch is now a single constant: 210px between every centre**, and every pill
on the row is the same 124px wide (SFDC was 100 — widened so the visual gaps match
the centre pitch). Care Agent 265 · SFDC 475 · Create & Edit 685 · Verify & Review
895 · Process & Track 1105.

Active scale dropped 1.5× → **1.3×**. A 124px pill at 1.3× is 161 wide, so the
clearance needed between centres falls from 155 to 143 against the 210 pitch —
81px of air at the tightest point, and nothing reads as stacked any more.

Everything downstream moved with the row: ABACUS/OMEGA to 895/1105, ARB to 1105,
and the whole right-hand column (Logistics, Oracle payments, Delta · RIMS, OTM)
out to 1268. Risers followed: `log-otm` 1372, the return loop 1392.

**The token lands instead of vanishing.** A `land` phase sits between `move` and
`work` (0.3s, collapsed to 0.01s under reduced-motion):

```
p>=1 (move) → phase='land', N[id].target=1.3   // node starts growing on impact
tokSc = u<.32 ? 1+.34*(u/.32) : 1.34*(1-ease((u-.32)/.68))
halo  r 12→38, opacity .3→0                    // impact ripple at the node
opacity holds to u=.58, then fades
```

The token pops 1.34× then collapses into the node while a ring spreads from it,
and the node's spring is already expanding — so the beat reads as a drop onto the
pill, not a disappearance. The progress pill stays lit through `land` so the rail
does not flicker between move and work.

**Toggle dot** on the selected tab blinks green (`--green-dot:#3DDC84`, 1.3s
ease-in-out, opacity 1→.4 plus an expanding 4px glow). Bright green, not the
`#1E8A4C` tick green — the dot sits on the deep navy pill and needs the lift.
Killed under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Heights unchanged: 1072 → 700, 682 → 679, 350 → 676.

### Palette v2 — hue separation over harmony

The first group palette kept every colour inside the blue–teal–violet band so it
would sit quietly next to the Dell blue. It sat too quietly: SFDC, the data
services and the modules all read as "some kind of blue", which defeats the point
of grouping.

Blue is now reserved for Streamliner alone, and the other five groups are spread
across the wheel instead:

| Group | Hex | Hue | Contrast on white |
|---|---|---|---|
| Streamliner modules | `#0672CB` | 207° blue | 4.91 |
| Case system (SFDC) | `#7C3AED` | 262° violet | 5.70 |
| People & channels | `#57575C` | neutral (5% sat) | 7.18 |
| Data services | `#B02071` | 326° magenta | 6.38 |
| Logistics | `#A15C00` | 34° amber | 5.19 |
| Finance | `#0B6E4F` | 161° green | 6.25 |

Minimum separation between any two saturated groups is **46°** (blue vs green),
and those two also differ sharply in warmth. People is deliberately near-neutral
— humans are not a system, and a grey reads that way without spending a hue.

Amber and green already exist in the Dell kit (`#A15C00`, `#1E8A4C`), so the set
still belongs to the same family. Finance green is darker than the progress-rail
tick green and is only ever an outline or a label, never a filled dot, so the two
do not compete.

### Legend v2

Headings removed — a swatch next to a word and an icon next to a word do not need
to be told what they are. The box tightened from 228×204 at `x:34 y:36` to
**236×160 at `x:16 y:20`**, pushed into the corner, rows starting at `y:48` with
the same 23px pitch. Bottom padding went from 43px to 17px, matching the top.
